  <p><i>June 2019 - Cloud Expo 2019</i></p>
  <p>Presentation about an experimentation we did at Data Theorem: building the same micro-service first using Google Cloud's Serverless platform, and then their container orchestration offering, to compare the benefits and downsides of each technology.</p>
  
  <h3><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/bluehat/2017/09/01/announcing-the-bluehat-v17-schedule/">Where, how, and why is SSL traffic on mobile getting intercepted?</a></h3>

  <h3><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/iossecurity">iOS Application Security</a></h3>
  <p><i>February 2016 - Book release</i></p>
  <p>I was the Technical Reviewer for David Thiel's "iOS Application Security". This book goes in great details about how to spot security issues affecting iOS Apps and how to avoid making these mistakes when building an App.</p>
  
  <h3><a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#trustkit-code-injection-on-ios-8-for-the-greater-good">TrustKit: Code Injection on iOS 8 for the Greater Good</a></h3>

  <p>Presentation on how I reverse-engineered Apple's undocumented Multipeer Connectivity Framework. I also uncovered a man-in-the-middle attack allowing an attacker to downgrade the encryption level of the connection; this issue was later fixed by Apple in iOS 9 as CVE-2015-5851.</p>
  
  <h3><a href="https://nabla-c0d3.github.io/documents/iSEC_Cryptocat_iOS.pdf">Security Audit of Cryptocat iOS</a></h3>

  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit">TrustKit iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit-Android">TrustKit Android</a></h3>
  <p>Open source libraries for "Drag & Drop" SSL pinning and SSL reporting in iOS/macOS/Android Apps.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze">SSLyze</a></h3>
  <p>Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it. It is designed to be fast and comprehensive, and should help organizations and testers identify misconfigurations affecting their SSL servers.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/trust_stores_observatory">Trust Store Observatory</a></h3>
  <p>Python tool to continuously monitor and record the content of the major platforms' root certificate stores.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2">SSL Kill Switch</a></h3>
  <p>Blackbox tool to disable SSL certificate validation - including certificate pinning - within OS X and iOS Apps. The initial release was presented at the <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/usa/bh-us-12-briefings.html#Diquet">Black Hat USA conference in 2012</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-conservatory">SSL Conservatory</a> - <i>No longer maintained</i></h3>
  <p>Correct implementation of SSL is crucial to secure transmission of data between clients and servers. However, this crucial task is frequently done improperly, due to complex APIs and lack of understanding of SSL fundamentals. The SSL Conservatory is intended to be a clearinghouse for well-documented and secure sample code to correctly implement SSL clients.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/Introspy-iOS/">Introspy</a> - <i>No longer maintained</i></h3>
  <p>Open-source security profiler for iOS, designed to help penetration testers understand what an application does at runtime.</p>
